## Purpose of the Meeting

To decide on any initial considerations and specifications for this product.

<!-- =========================================================================================== -->

## Notes

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

### Product Naming

**Product Name:** EntangleNet
**Tagline:** "Where voices connect instantly, everywhere"

This name has been chosen to fit in with Skye's other products, and because it is thematically
linked to the purpose of the product.

It has also been chosen because Skye is a big nerd, and so is Cephy.

### Product Overview

Voice chat software built for gaming guilds that focus on organized gameplay, e.g. mil-sim guilds
and organizations.

#### What the Product Will Achieve

This product/project will,

- Be Free and Open Source (FOSS)
- Be Low Latency
- Transmit and Handle High Quality Audio
- Be Highly Extensible (on both the client and server)
- Allow for Extension Through
  - Client and Server Plugins
  - Server Bots
  - DotConfig Files (e.g. RC files, etc)
  - Hooks
  - In-App GUI Based Settings and Options
  - ETC
- Allow for Permission Groups (server, channel, client)
- Utilize Security Best Practices
- Prioritize Personal and Data Privacy
- Utilize Client-Server Architecture
- Be Easily Installable and Deployable via Multiple Methods (e.g. Docker, Native Source Build, etc)
- Keep its Resource Usage Low on Both the Client and Server
- Be Well Documented

#### Features

By the release of version 1.0.0 this product will include the following features:

##### Permission System and Groups

- Tree based permission group systems
  - Permission groups can inherit from others
  - Permission groups are grouped by their inheritance

##### Voice Channels and Text Chats

- Each channel has an associated text chat
- Users can start a text chat between each other, i.e. Private DM's
- Channels are relational and have a hierarchy
  - A channels permission systems inherits based on this hierarchy
  - Each channel that is a child can,
    - Inherit its parents password
    - Define a new password for itself
    - Disable the password requirement for itself

##### Audio data, streams, and metadata

All audio data streams will include base metadata that defines

- The streams usage
- Target of the streams
- Information on how the target has been set
- Permissions for the stream
- Base audio codec data

Users may extend the metadata with custom data, this may be done by,

- Injecting new data into the metadata at a given Points
- Modification of incoming data at a specific point
- Modification of outgoing data, before sending

The systems that allow for this extension of metadata should act similarly to how an web-server's
middleware handles incoming and outgoing requests.

##### User Data

Each user/client may set data that relates to how they want to be perceived inside of servers.

When setting this data, a user may set this globally in an "account" like page, or at a server
specific level via using a system that's similar to TeamSpeak's bookmark system.

A users server specific persona (user data) can be modified by a server owner, or its
admin/moderator/staff team. These changes should be available to be made by the server team
even if the user that is being modified is not connected to the server.

The types of data that we require, as a minimum, to be tracked are:

- Username
- Profile Picture
- Tag line/Status
- Bio/About Me

#### Why This Product Has Been Created

No good alternative solution for guilds that focus on organized and structured content, like milsim
groups.

Noticed short-comings in all alternatives that we feel we can fix.

Want to provide a modern solution to this problem, via the usage of modern techniques.
